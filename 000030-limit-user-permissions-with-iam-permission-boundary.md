# Limit User Permissions With IAM Permission Boundary

See the workshop at <https://000030.awsstudygroup.com/>

## 1. Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> An IAM user/group can have
>
> - multiple _**permission policies**_ - called _identity policies_ - that specify what that IAM user/group can do.
> - one _**permissions boundary**_, which is also an identity policy, that limits the maximum permissions of the IAM user/group.
>
> See:
>
> - [Identity-based policies and resource-based policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html)
> - [Permissions boundaries for IAM entities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_boundaries.html)
