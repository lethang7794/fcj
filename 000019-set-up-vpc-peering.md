# Set up VPC Peering

See the workshop at <https://000019.awsstudygroup.com/>

## 1. Introduction

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A VPC Peering connection is a network **connection between two VPCs** that allows you to route traffic between them (using IPv4 or IPv6 _private_ addresses).
>
> - Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they were on the _same network_.

> [!TIP]
> Network ACL is a type of stateless firewall at the subnet-level.
>
> - NCAL can only be assigned to the subnet, but not to each Instance within the subnet.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cross-Peering DNS is a feature of VPC Peering that allows resources within one VPC to **resolve DNS of _another VPC_**.
