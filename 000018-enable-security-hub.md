# Enable Security Hub

See the workshop at <https://000018.awsstudygroup.com/>

## 1. Security Standards

## 2. Enable Security Hub

> [!TIP]
> The new Security Hub console doesn't show the information about _Enable AWS Config_ anymore.

> [!NOTE]
> After you enable Security Hub, it can take up to 2 hours to see the results from security checks for the newly enabled standards. Until then, the controls have a status of "No data".

## 3. Score for each set of criteria

> [!NOTE]
> Security Hub updates the calculated security score every 24 hours. For the administrator account, the score for a standard reflects both the administrator account and all of the member accounts.

## 4. Clean up resources
